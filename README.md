# **DSA Concepts & Problems in C++**  

This repository contains solutions and explanations for various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts**, implemented in **C++**. The content is based on the lessons from the YouTube channel **"CodeHelp - by Babbar"**, making it a structured learning resource for mastering DSA.  

## **Topics Covered**  
✔ **Recursion** – Power calculation, Fibonacci, factorial, climb stairs, say digits, and more.  
✔ **Arrays & Strings** – Searching, sorting, sliding window, and prefix sum techniques.  
✔ **Linked Lists** – Singly, doubly, circular, and operations like reversal, cycle detection.  
✔ **Stacks & Queues** – Stack operations, balanced parentheses, next greater element.  
✔ **Trees & Graphs** – Binary trees, BSTs, traversals, shortest path algorithms.  
✔ **Dynamic Programming** – Memoization, tabulation, and key problem-solving patterns.  
✔ **Sorting & Searching** – QuickSort, MergeSort, Binary Search, and optimizations.  

## **Getting Started**  

### **Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have **C++** installed. You can use any compiler like **G++** or an IDE like **VS Code, CodeBlocks, or Dev-C++**.
